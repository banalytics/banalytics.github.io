This blog aims to discuss issues & ideas related to analytics / data science, broad term, 
right? I would like to talk about practical experience in all areas spanning from data 
cleaning and processing through visualization, machine learning as well as translating all
of this into business language & value.  

### More Information

I work as a Lead Data Scientist in Piano - a company focused on monetizing online content.
The aim of data science in Piano is to provide data driven actionable insights for over 1200 clients
including sites such as CNBC, Newsweek and locally SME or .týždeň. In the small team I lead we use
technologies such as BigQuery, R or Python. Our work spans from benchmarking across hundreds of sites
to deep dives on user level. I organize Banalytics - a meetup focused on analytical community
in Slovakia (see facebook link below) and helped organize the first edition of  MeasureCamp Slovakia.
My formal education includes a PhD in applied stats.
